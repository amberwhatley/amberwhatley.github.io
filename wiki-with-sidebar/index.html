                    Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len 
                    Wiseman in his feature film directorial debut, from a 
                    screenplay by Danny McBride, based on a story by Kevin 
                    Grevioux, Wiseman, and McBride. The film stars Kate 
                    Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, 
                    and Bill Nighy. The plot centers on the secret history of 
                    vampires and lycans (an abbreviated form of lycanthrope, 
                    which means werewolf). The main plot revolves around 
                    Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer hunting Lycans. 
                    She finds herself attracted to a human, Michael Corvin 
                    (Speedman), who is being targeted by the Lycans. After 
                    Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether 
                    to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and 
                    save him.

                    Underworld premiered at the Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in 
                    Los Angeles, California on September 15, 2003, and was 
                    released in the United States on September 19, by Sony 
                    Pictures Releasing. The film received generally negative 
                    reviews from critics, but a smaller number of reviewers 
                    praised elements such as the film’s Gothic visuals, Kate 
                    Beckinsale’s performance, and the extensively worked-out 
                    vampire–werewolf mythology that serves as the film’s 
                    backstory. A surprise hit, the film grossed over $95 
                    million worldwide against a production budget of $22 
                    million and originated a franchise.The film was followed 
                    by Underworld: Evolution in 2006.
