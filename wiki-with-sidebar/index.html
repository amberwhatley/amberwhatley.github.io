                <h1>Underworld - Film(2003)</h1>
                <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>

                <p>
                    Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len
                   Wiseman in his feature film directorial debut, from a
                   screenplay by Danny McBride, based on a story by Kevin
                   Grevioux, Wiseman, and McBride. The film stars Kate
                   Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly,
                   and Bill Nighy. The plot centers on the secret history of
                   vampires and lycans (an abbreviated form of lycanthrope,
                   which means werewolf). The main plot revolves around
                   Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer hunting Lycans.
                   She finds herself attracted to a human, Michael Corvin
                   (Speedman), who is being targeted by the Lycans. After
                   Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether
                   to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and
                   save him.

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    For generations, vampires and Lycans, an ancient species 
                    of werewolf, have secretly waged war. The vampires gain 
                    the upper hand when Lycan leader Lucian seemingly dies at 
                    the hands of vampire Kraven, who becomes the 
                    second-in-command to the vampires' leading elders. Selene, 
                    a member of an elite group of vampire assassins known as 
                    "Death Dealers", continues to pursue the extermination of 
                    the Lycans despite other vampires no longer perceiving them
                    as a threat.
