            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 cups milk
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 tablespoons instant dry yeast
                </li>
                <li>
                    ¼ cup granulated sugar
                </li>
                <li>
                    ⅓ cup unsalted butter soft + 1 extra tablespoon butter 
                    for brushing
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 eggs
                </li>
                <li>
                    6 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 teaspoons fine sea salt
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
         <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Heat the milk</b> until lukewarm. Don't overheat the milk or 
            it will spoil the yeast.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mix</b>: Pour the lukewarm milk, active dry yeast, and
                granulated sugar into a large bowl (or the stand mixer bowl). 
                Add the soft butter and the lightly beaten eggs. Mixwell 
                either with the kneading attachments of the stand mixer or 
                with a handheld mixer fitted with dough hooks.
            </li>
            <li>
                If not using a machine, stir well with a wooden spoon until 
                the ingredients are mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Knead</b>: Add the flour and the salt to the bowl and mix 
                with the dough hooks until the dough starts pulling away from 
                the sides of the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                If making the dough without a machine, stir in about half of 
                the flour using a wooden spoon. Start adding the remaining 
                flour, stirring with the spoon for as long as possible. When 
                the dough becomes too sturdy to stir, turn it on the lightly 
                floured working surface and knead with your hands until the 
                dough is only slightly sticky and still soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>You could add 1 or 2 tablespoons extra flour</b>, if 
                necessary, but keep in mind that the dough should remain soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Let rise</b>: Place the dough in a clean bowl, cover with a 
                kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 1 hour and 30 minutes 
                in a warm place, it should double in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Form yeast rolls</b>: Lightly grease a large baking tray 
                of about 30x40 cm/12x16 inches. Punch down the dough. Form 24 
                rolls. Place them on the baking tray leaving a little space 
                between them. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 
                another hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, <b>preheat the oven</b> to 180 degrees 
                Celsius/ 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bake</b>: When the rolls have nicely risen, they will 
                come together, touching each other on the tray. Bake the easy
                yeast rolls for 12 to 14 minutes, until nicely golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Brush</b> them immediately with 1 tablespoon melted 
                (or very soft) butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Serve</b>
